# Better-Vanilla
A relatively lightweight, vanilla-like modpack in the lastest version of minecraft 1.21.11. It is designed to provide the BEST VANILLA EXPERIENCE (in my own opinion). The core datapack "arms_race" improves many disappointing vanilla features and try to utilize more unpopular and mediocre items to create an interconnected mechanism for better playability. 

## Essential Dependencies
1. java edition minecraft, 1.21.11 (not compatible with earlier version, but possibly for later version)
2. fabric & fabric api 
3. other 2 datapakcs "special_loot_table" & "special_recipe"
4. mod "Terralith"
