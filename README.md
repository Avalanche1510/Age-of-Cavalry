# Age-of-Cavalry
A relatively lightweight, vanilla-like modpacks in the lastest version of minecraft 1.21.11. It is designed to provide the BEST VANILLA EXPERIENCE (in my own opinion). The core datapack "arms_race" improves many disappointing vanilla features and try to utilize more unpopular and mediocre items to create an interconnected mechanism for better playability. 

The first reason for calling the core datapack "arms_race" is that both players and mobs can get more resources to arm themselves, and hence the survival became more strategic and challenging. Those unpopular items now have a chance to revive.
The second reason for calling the core datapack "arms_race" is quite simple: mobs form 4 main alliances, and they are automatically hostile to each other now. Players are no longer fighting alone.
The final reason for calling the whole modpack "Age of Cavalry" is that not only can players have much more practical mounts like camels, horses, and happy ghast, but mobs can also have various new cavalry units. The combat mechanism of vanilla Minecraft will undergo a drastic reform!
